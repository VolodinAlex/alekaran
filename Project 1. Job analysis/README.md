### __Description__
You will have at your disposal a resume database downloaded from the job search site hh.ru.  
Issue: Some job seekers do not indicate their desired salary when compiling their resume.  
This interferes with the HeadHunter recommendation system, which selects a list of the most suitable vacancies for job seekers and a list of the most suitable specialists for employers.  
HeadHunter wants to build a model that automatically determines the approximate salary level that is suitable for the user, based on the information that he indicated about himself. But, as you know, before a model can be built, the data must be transformed, explored, and cleaned. This is our task with you!

### __Tasks__
