### __1. Description__
The company plans to launch a new promotion to sell as many tours as possible. The team developed two versions of the landing page of the company's official website and conducted A/B testing. As a result of the experiment, data were collected.  

### __2. Tasks__
Business task: to analyze the effectiveness of both variants of the landing page by two criteria at once: purchase conversion and average check. Based on the analysis, it is necessary to draw conclusions and make a decision: which of the design options is more preferable.

### **3. About data**
- user_id - user id-number
- group	- A/B-testing hroup (A-contol, B-test)
- purchase - whether the user made a purchase of the tour (1 - yes, 0 - no)
- price - the price of the purchased tour (if the purchase did not take place, the price is 0)

The company offers the following tour options:
- Thailand - 100,000 rubles;
- Turkey - 60,000 rubles;
- Maldives - 200,000 rubles;
- St. Petersburg - 10,000 rubles;
- Kamchatka - 150,000 rubles.

### **4. Stages**
- Conditions
- Task 1-14
- Conclusion

### **5. Results**
AB testing was carried out, conclusions were drawn about the effectiveness of the new version of the landing page, and recommendations were given.

### **6. Conclusion**
the second version of the landing page is preferable, because in the absence of a difference in conversion (performing a target action), it has a clear advantage in the size of the average check.
