### __1. Description__
This task is based on the [Kaggle: Churn for Bank Customers](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/churn-for-bank-customers).  

The bank is looking to you for help: they want to develop a customer retention loyalty campaign, but to do so, they need you to figure out the root causes of customer churn. In other words, it is necessary to establish how departed customers differ from loyal ones and how the various features that define customers are interconnected.

After an intelligence analysis to identify the most important churn indicators, the bank will be able to build a machine learning model that will predict customer churn.

### __2. Tasks__
It is necessary to prepare a report in the form of answers to the questions below in the form of a graph and detailed conclusions that you can draw from it.

### **3. About data**
- RowNumber — corresponds to the record (row) number and has no effect on the output.
- CustomerId — contains random values and has no effect on customer leaving the bank.
- Surname — the surname of a customer has no impact on their decision to leave the bank.
- CreditScore — can have an effect on customer churn, since a customer with a higher credit score is less likely to leave the bank.
- Geography — a customer’s location can affect their decision to leave the bank.
- Gender — it’s interesting to explore whether gender plays a role in a customer leaving the bank.
- Ageb— this is certainly relevant, since older customers are less likely to leave their bank than younger ones.
- Tenure — refers to the number of years that the customer has been a client of the bank. Normally, older clients are more loyal and less likely to leave a bank.
- Balance — also a very good indicator of customer churn, as people with a higher balance in their accounts are less likely to leave the bank compared to those with lower balances.
- NumOfProducts — refers to the number of products that a customer has purchased through the bank.
- HasCrCard — denotes whether or not a customer has a credit card. This column is also relevant, since people with a credit card are less likely to leave the bank.
- IsActiveMember — active customers are less likely to leave the bank.
- EstimatedSalary — as with balance, people with lower salaries are more likely to leave the bank compared to those with higher salaries.
- Exited — whether or not the customer left the bank.

### **4. Stages**
- Data preparation and exploration
- Task 1-10
- Conclusion

### **5. Results**
Ten detailed graphs were constructed with detailed findings for each.

### **6. Conclusion**
Several groups of clients have been identified that are most likely to leave. Recommendations are given to improve customer focus.
